        <h2>Standing Reservations</h2>

        <p class="lead">Each semester, VPAC provides its organizations with the opportunity to reserve
          spaces for recurring rehearsals with the Reservations and Events Office for the upcoming semester. Each group
          is allowed 2 time slots for any rehearsal space on campus to be used solely for weekly rehearsals or another
          recurring event. Groups also have the opportunity to reserve a third standing reservation that will be
          confirmed with the Reservations and Events Office on a monthly basis.</p>

        <h2>Additional Space</h2>

        <p class="lead">If a group is in need of space for non-recurring meetings or rehearsals, they may
          reserve space through <a href="https://apphost1a.its.vanderbilt.edu/ems-osr/" target="_blank">Virtual EMS</a>,
          Vanderbiltâ€™s online reservation system. Once an account is requested and
          created, a group leader is able to look through rooms based on location, size, or function, and submit
          reservation requests that will be directed to the Reservations and Events Office.</p>
