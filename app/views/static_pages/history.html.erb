        <p class="lead text-center">In the fall of 2006, a group of Vanderbilt students established VPAC with a purpose of uniting the performing arts community at Vanderbilt. Inspired by Princeton Universityâ€™s Performing Arts Council (PPAC), VPAC created a forum for its 16 original groups to collaborate and advocate for the performing arts. In its first year as an organization, VPAC hosted the debut performance of Spotlight, a production designed to showcase and recruit talent within the Vanderbilt student population.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center">Years later, VPAC has expanded and grown to now represent 26 unique organizations who specialize in dance, music, theatre, comedy, and much more. While the original Board was established by members of JPAC and Vandy Taal, the current Board consists of members of 10 different organizations, including BhangraDores, Harmonic Notion, Masala-SACE, Momentum, The Original Cast, Vanderbilt Off-Broadway, Vanderbilt University Concert Choir, Vanderbilt University Theatre, VIBE, and Voce. In addition to the annual Spotlight showcase, VPAC produces monthly performances through Main Attraction and finishes the year with Encore, an awards showcase.</p>
